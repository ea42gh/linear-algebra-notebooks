**Scalar** an element in a **field** $\mathscr{F}$ (numbers with the operations +,-, $\times$, $\div$  )

**Remark**: combining scalars with one of the above operation yields a number in that field:
- $\mathscr{F}$ is _closed_ under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

**Examples of fields:**
- the field of real numbers
- the field of rational numbers
- the field of complex numbers.
- the field of scalars of the form $a + b \sqrt{2}$, whare $a$ and $b$  are any rational numbers.

**Example:**
- the set of positive and negative integers is not a field:
  integers are not closed under division.
