A **vector** is an ordered set of #scalar s 

**Example** :
	$u = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 5 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$

The **#entry** $u_i$ is the $i^{th}$ scalar in the vector. By convention, the first entry is at the top of the vector representation:  $u_1 = 1$.

The **#size** of the vector is the number of entries.

We write $u \in \mathbb{R}^3$, to show that $u$ is an element of the set of vectors of size 3 with entries in $\mathbb{R}$.


**Remark** This notion of vectors will be generalized.
