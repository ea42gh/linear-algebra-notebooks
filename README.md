The notebooks use both Julia and Python. To use interactively,
you may have to install the libraries.

The itikz python library is used to generate figures of the matrix operations using LaTeX.<br>
The itikz directory of this library must be in your python path.
Install from

Some of the Julia Notebooks use a (mostly outdated) package LAcode.jl
>   using Pkg<br>
>   Pkg.develop(path="location_of_the_directory/LAcode.jl")
